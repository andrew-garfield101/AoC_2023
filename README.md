# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. The primary language used is Python, with additional solutions in Mojo for exploratory and learning purposes.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and problem-solving techniques.

## Structure

Each day's challenge is placed in its own directory, named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number. For example, `day01`, `day02`, etc.

## Languages Used

- **Python:** The primary language for solving the challenges. 
- **Mojo:** Used as a secondary language for select problems. The purpose of using Mojo is to explore its capabilities and learn more about the language.

## Running the Solutions

To run a Python solution, navigate to the respective day's directory and execute the script. For example:

```bash
